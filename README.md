# WritingEfficientPythonCode
Writing efficient Python code can help reduce runtime and save computational resources
Python's built-in data structures, functions, and modules to write cleaner, faster, and more efficient code. 
1. explore how to time and profile code in order to find bottlenecks.
2. eliminating these bottlenecks, and other bad design patterns, using Python's Standard Library, NumPy, and pandas.
